# Static site deployment example

The goal was to have a cheap to maintain representative WebSite.
Ideally, with the benefits of fast feedback when developing locally, updating content on holiday.
Ideally, having extension points when the site would scale.

## Architecture

Main components:

```mermaid
graph LR;
    Sanity_Studio -- Store dynamic content --> Sanity_Content
    Sanity_Studio -- Code saved --> GitHub
    GitHub -- Fetch on build --> Sanity_Content
    React -- Code saved --> GitHub
    GitHub -- Static site deployed --> GitHubPages
```

Deployment flow:

```mermaid
graph LR;
    Sanity_Studio -- Publish public version --> Sanity_Content
    Sanity_Studio -- Trigger regeneration via GitHub token --> GitHub
```

Preview flow:

```mermaid
graph LR;
    Sanity_Studio -- Store draft version --> Sanity_Content
    GitHubPages -- Fetch draft version via Sanity token --> Sanity_Content
```

## Local development

```bash
nvm use
yarn
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## Static version

```bash
yarn build
yarn export
yarn view
```

Proxies `/out` via [http://127.0.0.1:8080](http://127.0.0.1:8080)

## Deployment

- Merge to `main`
- Github actions would [build](.github/workflows/build.yml) and [deploy](.github/workflows/deploy.yml)

Open [https://www.baneliene.lt/](https://www.baneliene.lt/)

## Content management

[https://baneliene-lt.sanity.studio/](https://baneliene-lt.sanity.studio/)

Which is generated via code in [`cms`](./cms/README.md) folder:

```bash
cd cms/
yarn
yarn dev
yarn build
yarn deploy
```
